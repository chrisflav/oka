# The gluing **is** the fibre product: uniqueness of the lift, the limit cone, and `HasPullback`

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackGlue.lean` glues the ambient pullbacks `Uᵢ ×_Z Y` into an analytic
space `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.glued`, produces the two projections
`…p1` and `…p2` and the square `…p_comm` they make commute, and lifts a competing cone into it
with `…gluedLift`, `…gluedLift_p1` and `…gluedLift_p2`. Its own *What this does not do* names
what is left, and the first item is the **uniqueness** of that lift.

**This file is that item and the two that follow from it.** It proves the lift unique, assembles
the limit cone `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.gluedIsLimit`, and concludes
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.hasPullback_of_cover`: a cospan whose first leg has a base
covered by opens along which the base change already exists has a fibre product.

## The one geometric fact, and it is the whole of the work

Uniqueness reduces, by `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_of_opens` over the preimage family
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.conePreimage`, to a statement about one member: the
restriction of a competing `m` to `s.fst ⁻¹' Uᵢ` agrees with the `i`-th piece of the lift. Both
sides land in the image of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.ι`, and once they are read
there the comparison is `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.hom_ext` on the ambient pullback and
nothing else.

**Reading them there is the fact that had to be proved**, and it is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.range_base_ι`:

    Set.range (ι i).base = p1 ⁻¹' Uᵢ

The inclusion `⊆` is `…ι_comp_p1` — the composite is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.toBase`, which factors through `Uᵢ`. **The inclusion `⊇`
is where the glue datum is used**, and it is the only point in this file where a point of the
gluing is decomposed:

* `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_jointly_surjective` writes the point as
  `ι j q`, for some `j` and some `q` of the `j`-th ambient pullback;
* `…ι_comp_p1` turns the hypothesis into `toBase j q ∈ Uᵢ`, so `q` lies in the preimage of `Uᵢ`
  under `toBase j`;
* that preimage **is** the image of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.fV j i`, by
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.range_base_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` — the member map of the datum
  is a base change of the inclusion of `Uᵢ` and its image is what one expects of one;
* and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.fV_comp_ι`, the glue condition, moves the resulting
  point across the transition into the image of `ι i`.

**No `t'` and no cocycle appears**, which is the same division of labour the lift's own
compatibility lemma reports: the cocycle law was discharged when the datum was built.

## This is `pullbackP1Iso`'s content, and not its statement

Mathlib gets uniqueness from `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pullback.pullbackP1Iso`, an isomorphism
`W ×_X Uᵢ ≅ Uᵢ ×_Z Y`, and that isomorphism needs
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pullback.lift_comp_ι` before it, which needs
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pullback.pullbackFstιToV` before *it*. **None of those three is
transcribed here and none is needed**, and neither is
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pullback.gluedLiftPullbackMap`, which is not one of the three — it
belongs to Mathlib's route to the lift rather than to its route to uniqueness, and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackGlue.lean` had already disposed of it there.

**The reason that file gave for `gluedLiftPullbackMap` is the reason for the other three as
well**, which is what it did not predict: the pieces of the lift are open subspaces of the cone's
apex rather than categorical pullbacks, so what an isomorphism onto `W ×_X Uᵢ` would be used for
is to *factor a morphism through `ι i`* — and a morphism whose image lies in the image of an open
immersion factors through it directly, with no object named.

That factorisation is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.liftι`, which is
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.lift` at `(ι i).toLRSHom` with its
`ℂ`-linearity supplied by `ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_comp` at the factorisation — the same
two-line promotion `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict` is built by. The open-immersion
hypothesis it needs is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isOpenImmersion_toLRSHom_ι`, which
is `AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.GlueData.ι_isOpenImmersion` after
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.toLRSHom_ι` has rewritten the goal to the datum's own
inclusion. **It is a theorem and not an instance**, for the reason
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isOpenImmersion_map_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` gives for the same
shape: the two spellings are `rfl`-equal and are different discrimination-tree keys, so a caller
ascribes it in a `haveI` rather than a key being added to the instance graph.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.range_base_ι`: **the image of the `i`-th member of the
  gluing is the preimage of `Uᵢ` under the first projection.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.isOpenImmersion_toLRSHom_ι`: the underlying morphism of
  that member inclusion is an open immersion of locally ringed spaces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.liftι` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.liftι_fac`: **a morphism into the gluing whose image
  lies in that member factors through it**, as a morphism of analytic spaces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.range_base_ofRestrict_comp_subset_ι`: a
  competing cone's `m`, restricted to `s.fst ⁻¹' Uᵢ`, satisfies that hypothesis.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.liftι_eq_liftMember`: **the factorisation it produces is
  the `i`-th piece of the lift**, by `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback.hom_ext`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.gluedLift_uniq`: **the lift is unique** — Mathlib's
  `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pullback.gluedIsLimit`'s uniqueness half, over
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.gluedIsLimit`: **the gluing is the fibre product** —
  the limit cone.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.hasPullback_of_cover`: **the cospan has a fibre
  product**, Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pullback.hasPullback_of_cover`.

## What this does not do

* **It does not make `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` a category with pullbacks, and nothing below
  does.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.hasPullback_of_cover` asks for a family of opens
  of `X` which covers `X` **and along which the base change is already known** — the hypothesis
  `[∀ i, HasPullback (X.ofRestrict (U i) ≫ f) g]`, inherited from
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackBlock.lean` — and nothing here produces such a family for a general
  `f` and `g`. `#synth CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` fails at
  the commit that adds this file, run with the category positional and not grepped.

  **The bullet ended there, and said in its own words that the probe fails, until 2026-09-08**,
  when `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackReduction.lean` produced that family and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullbacks` made the probe succeed. The `#synth` sentence above
  is pinned to the commit that adds *this* file and is unaffected; what is retired is the reading
  of it as a claim about the tree, and the words *nothing below does* are what replace that
  reading, `below` being this file.
* **It does not do the reduction of a general cospan**, which is what would produce that family:
  Mathlib covers `X` by affines, then `Y`, then `Z`, and takes three theorems and two symmetry
  arguments to do it. The analytic analogue covers by local models and is
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackReduction.lean`: six declarations for the reduction, of which four are
  the transcribable ones — the base case, the two covers and the family a general cospan needs —
  and two more for the predicate *is a local model on the nose* that the substitutions run on.

  **This bullet read *The analytic analogue would cover by local models, and its length is not
  measured anywhere in this repository* until 2026-09-08**, and *The three declarations named as
  still owed by `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackGlue.lean`'s* What this does not do *are the ones below;
  the fourth item, the reduction, is untouched by this file and stays owed.* Both were exact when
  written; taxis #1909 measured the length and the file above supplied it, and the fourth item is
  no longer owed by anything.
* **It states no `CategoryTheory.IsPullback`.** `…gluedIsLimit` is a
  `CategoryTheory.Limits.IsLimit` of the cone `…p_comm` presents, which is what
  `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullback` consumes; the `CategoryTheory.IsPullback` spelling would be
  one `CategoryTheory.IsPullback.of_isLimit` away and nothing in this repository asks for it yet.
* **Nothing about base change of a class along the projections.**
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleOver.lean`'s bullet on base change is a statement about
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFiniteEtale` and does not follow from a fibre product existing;
  the same sentence appears at the foot of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackGlue.lean` and this file
  does not change it.

/-! ### The image of a member of the gluing -/

/-- **The image of the `i`-th member of the gluing is the preimage of `Uᵢ` under the first
projection.**

This is the one geometric fact this file proves and everything else in it is bookkeeping; the
module docstring's section *The one geometric fact, and it is the whole of the work* gives the
four steps of `⊇` and says which declaration supplies each.

**`⊆` costs nothing**: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.ι_comp_p1` reads the composite as
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.toBase`, whose second factor is the inclusion of `Uᵢ`, so
every point of the image is in `Uᵢ` by the second component of a point of an open subspace.

**`⊇` is where the datum is used**, and the step that is not formal is the third: the preimage of
`Uᵢ` under `toBase j` is the *image* of the member map `fV j i`, which holds because that member
map is a base change of the inclusion of `Uᵢ` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.range_base_pullbackFst_ofRestrict` computes the image of such a
base change. **No `t'` and no cocycle law appears here**; the transition `t j i` is used only to
move the point, by the glue condition
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.fV_comp_ι`. -/

/-- **A morphism into the gluing whose image lies in the `i`-th member factors through it**, as a
morphism of complex analytic spaces.

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.IsOpenImmersion.lift` one category down, promoted by
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCLinearHom.of_comp` at its own factorisation — the same two-line construction
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftRestrict` is, and for the same reason: the lift is a morphism
*over* the gluing, both the morphism it factors and the member inclusion are `ℂ`-linear, so
linearity of the factor is contravariant functoriality of `Γ` and nothing is transported.

**This is what stands in for Mathlib's `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Pullback.pullbackP1Iso`.** That
isomorphism exists there to say which object the preimage of `Uᵢ` in the gluing is; here the
question a caller asks is only *does this morphism factor through `ι i`*, and an open immersion
answers that from a containment of images without an object being named. -/

This is the hypothesis `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.liftι` asks for, discharged from
the *first* of the two triangles alone: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Pullback.range_base_ι`
turns the goal into a statement about `p1`, `h₁` turns `p1 ∘ m` into `s.fst`, and what is left is
that a point of `s.pt|(s.fst ⁻¹' Uᵢ)` is in `s.fst ⁻¹' Uᵢ` by its own second component. **The
