# The fibre product of two local models over a third

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutProduct.lean` makes the zero locus of the appended family
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutFamily` the binary product of two local models. This file
cuts that product down once more: given `a : X ⟶ S` and `b : Y ⟶ S` between local models presented
by cut-out data, **the zero locus inside `X × Y` of the `p` differences of the two composites to
`ℂ^p` is the fibre product `X ×_S Y`**, and `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullback a b` follows.

This is the first `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullback` instance in this repository over a cospan
**neither of whose legs is the inclusion of an open subspace and neither of which is finite
étale** — the two shapes `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean` and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean` supply. **The second shape read *is finite étale
with Hausdorff source* until 2026-09-14**, when the separation axiom came out of that file; the
sentence is about which shapes the two files supply and the cospan here is a leg of neither, at
the wider shape as at the narrower. `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean` and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean` each carried a clause recording the absence of a third shape and
both are narrowed by this file; they are what a sweep for the phrase *cospan neither of whose
legs* over every tracked `.lean` and `.md` at `c00e2a1`, the commit this file is added on, read as
one whitespace-normalised string per file, returns besides
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean`'s own — which is about the diagonal and is bounded to that
file by the word *here* — and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalIso.lean`'s own dated record of the wording
it retired earlier the same day.

## Why the cutting family is a family on the product and not on its ambient

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutFamily`'s two blocks are **pullbacks of sections of the
ambient** `ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W` along the two ambient legs, which is why
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` accepts them and why that product cost no analysis. The
`p` differences here are not of that shape: `a` and `b` are morphisms *out of the two subspaces*,
so their coordinate pullbacks are sections of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` itself,
and a global section of a local model need not extend to the `ℂ^n|V` that model is cut out in.
This is the gap `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutCompose.lean`'s header records, and what closes it is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspace` — the zero locus of finitely many global
sections of an *arbitrary* analytic space, which is `Oka/AnalyticSpace/ZeroLocus.lean`'s subject.
**So this file cuts down with the general zero locus and not with
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut`**, and the object it produces is not presented as a local
model by anything below.

## The mapping property of the zero locus is here, and its placement is forced

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/ZeroLocus.lean`'s `## What is not here` says in terms that it composes no
mapping property for `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspace`, and names the recipe:
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift`, `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.isCLinearHom_lift`, and the
faithfulness of `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.forgetToLocallyRingedSpace` for uniqueness.
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceLift` below is that recipe run.

**It could not have been stated in that file**, and this is measured rather than asserted:
`Oka.AnalyticSpace.Factorisation`, where `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift` and
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.isCLinearHom_lift` are declared, is **not** in
`Oka.AnalyticSpace.ZeroLocus`'s import closure — walked through `scripts/import_cost.py`'s
`IMPORT` pattern over its nesting-aware `strip_comments`, `Oka`-prefixed edges, transitively
closed. A scratch importing `Oka.AnalyticSpace.ZeroLocus` alone reports
`Unknown constant 'ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift'`. This is the same shape as the placement of
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftHom`, which `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutProduct.lean` explains at
its own head: a mapping property lands with the first file that can state it.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_restrict_complexAffineSpace` is a different case and its
placement **is** a preference, said so rather than left implicit. It mentions no product, no zero
locus and no fibre product, and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/HomToComplex.lean` — where
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_complexAffineSpace` lives — reaches
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofRestrict` and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_ofRestrict`
through `Oka.AnalyticSpace.OpenSubspace`, which is in its import closure, so that file could hold
it with its body unchanged. It is here because it arrives with its only consumer, and moving it is
a one-declaration move a later push can make.

## The route

Write `X` and `Y` for the two local models and `S` for the base, all three
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` of a cut-out datum, and `P` for
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` of the two cutting families.

1. **The two composites to `ℂ^p`.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.toAffineOfCutOut` is the
   immersion of `S` into `ℂ^p|U` followed by the inclusion of that open subspace, so that the two
   composites `P ⟶ ℂ^p` land in the *whole* affine space and their coordinate pullbacks are
   pullbacks of `ComplexAnalytic.coord`. Composing with the inclusion rather than stopping at
   `ℂ^p|U` is what lets step 4 be `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_complexAffineSpace`.
2. **The cutting family.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.eqCutFamily` is the `p` differences of
   those two tuples of pullbacks. Subtraction of global sections is a ring operation and needs
   nothing new; each member is a section of `P` and of nothing smaller.
3. **The object.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspace` of `P` at that family. Its
   immersion into `P` is a monomorphism, which is where uniqueness comes from.
4. **The square commutes.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_ofCutOut` cancels the immersion
   of `S`, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_restrict_complexAffineSpace` reduces the
   remaining equation of morphisms into `ℂ^p|U` to the `p` coordinate pullbacks, and each of those
   is the vanishing of one member of the cutting family — which is free, from
   `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.pullbackΓ_zeroLocusSubspaceι_eq_zero` and the fact that pulling
   a section back is a ring homomorphism. **This is the direction that needs the equality of two
   morphisms to be detected by coordinates**, and it is the whole of the new content.
5. **The lift.** A cone is a pair into `X` and `Y` whose composites to `S` agree.
   `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutLift` puts it in `P`, and the cone's own commutation —
   pushed along `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.toAffineOfCutOut` — is exactly the vanishing of the
   `p` differences, so `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceLift` factors it through the
   zero locus. **No `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_complexAffineSpace` is used here**: the
   cone's equation is transported forward and not detected.
6. **Uniqueness.** Two cancellations: the immersion into `P` is a monomorphism, and
   `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_prodCutOut` is uniqueness in `P`.

**Nothing here is analysis and nothing here computes a stalk.** Every step is a cancellation, a
ring operation on global sections, or a lemma of `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutProduct.lean` and
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/ZeroLocus.lean` applied to the output of the one before it.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceLift`: **the mapping property of the zero locus
  of global sections**, at the analytic level.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceHom`: **the morphism between zero loci a
  morphism of the ambient spaces induces**, when the family upstairs is the pullback of the one
  downstairs.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.toAffineOfCutOut`: a local model read in `ℂ^p`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.eqCutFamily`: **the `p` differences that cut the fibre product
  out of the product.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOut`: **the fibre product object.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutι`: its immersion into the product.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutFst` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutSnd`: the two projections.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutLift`: the morphism a cone induces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutIsoPullback`: the identification of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOut` with `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback a b`.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_restrict_complexAffineSpace`: **a morphism into an open
  subspace of `ℂ^p` is determined by the coordinate pullbacks of its composite with the
  inclusion.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_zeroLocusSubspace`: a morphism into the zero locus is
  determined by its composite with the immersion.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceHom_comp` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_zeroLocusSubspaceHom`: **that morphism is over the one
  it is induced by, and it is finite whenever that one is.** The second is the first consumer of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isCutOutBy_of_comp_eq`
  (`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean`).
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOut_condition`: **the square commutes.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutLift_fst`,
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutLift_snd` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_fibreProdCutOut`: the two triangles and uniqueness.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLimitPullbackConeFibreProdCutOut` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_fibreProdCutOut`: **the square is a pullback square.**
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofCutOut`: hence
  `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullback a b`, as an instance.

## What is not here

* **`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`.**
  `#synth CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` **fails** at the commit
  that adds this file — elaborated in a two-line `import Oka` probe with the category positional,
  so that it is fixed by the statement and not by a named argument, which is the false alarm taxis
  #1821 records — and it will keep failing until the local fibre products below are glued. A
  general analytic space is only *locally* a local model, and gluing is the next rung; this
  repository has the machinery for it in `Oka/CategoryTheory/GlueData.lean`,
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Glue.lean` and `Oka/Geometry/RingedSpace/PresheafedSpace/Gluing.lean`, and
  nothing below uses any of it. **A reader who takes this file for the general fibre product has
  been misled, and this paragraph is what prevents that.**

  **The gluing happened and the prediction held exactly.**
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackReduction.lean` made
  `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` a theorem on 2026-09-08,
  and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_of_isCutOutModel` — its base case — is
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasPullback_ofCutOut` below with three presentations substituted
  in, so this file is the bottom rung of that ladder and not a detour from it. **Every sentence
  above stands**: the `#synth` is pinned to the commit that adds this file, *below* is this file,
  and a reader who takes this file for the general fibre product is still misled — the general one
  is four declarations further on.
* **Nothing about the fibre product on points.** The carrier of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOut` is the zero locus of the differences inside the
  carrier of the product, and no statement below identifies it with a set of pairs agreeing over
  `S`, in the way `Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean` does for its own base change with
  `Function.Pullback`.
* **`CategoryTheory.MorphismProperty.IsStableUnderBaseChange` for any class.** That quantifies over
  every cospan with a leg in the class, including cospans of spaces that are not local models, and
  nothing below carries a class across the square built here.

  **The sentence above is unchanged by the push that adds
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_zeroLocusSubspaceHom` below, and this paragraph is why it
  did not have to change.** That theorem *does* carry a class across a square: it carries
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.IsFinite` across
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceHom_comp`, the square of a zero locus and the zero
  locus of its pulled-back family. But that is not *the square built here* — the square built here
  is the fibre-product one, and nothing below carries a class across **that**, which is what the
  sentence says and said before. The square it does carry one across is a commuting square and not
  a limit: nothing below identifies its source with a fibre product. **So nothing in this bullet is
  retired by that push**, and the class quantifier is untouched either way, one class across one
  shape of commuting square not being `IsStableUnderBaseChange` for any class.
* **Independence of the presentations.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOut` is indexed
  by the three cutting families and the two morphisms, exactly as
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` is indexed by two families; two presentations of the
  same three spaces give two objects, canonically isomorphic through
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.fibreProdCutOutIsoPullback` at each. Nothing below states that
  isomorphism.
* **The diagonal, and hence nothing about separatedness.** `A ⟶ A ×_S A` is an instance of the
  square below at `a = b`, and no declaration below names it or reads anything off it. That is
  what taxis #1772's monomorphism argument wants, and it wants it for arbitrary covers rather than
  for local models.

The hypothesis is stated in the `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ` spelling rather than

/-! ### The zero locus of a pulled-back family, over the zero locus of the family -/

section ZeroLocusHom

variable {E B : AnalyticSpace.{u}} {k : ℕ}

/-- **The zero locus of a pulled-back family, over the zero locus of the family.**

For `φ : E ⟶ B` and global sections `s` of `B`, the zero locus of `fun j ↦ φ.pullbackΓ (s j)` in
`E` maps to the zero locus of `s` in `B`, over `φ`. It is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceLift` applied to the immersion followed by `φ`,
whose pullbacks of the `s j` vanish by
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ_comp` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.pullbackΓ_zeroLocusSubspaceι_eq_zero`.

**Nothing here identifies this with a fibre product, and nothing below needs the
identification.** What the finiteness statement consumes is the square, and no declaration of this
repository says that the zero locus of a pulled-back family is a `CategoryTheory.Limits.pullback`
— the only `CategoryTheory.IsPullback` below is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isPullback_fibreProdCutOut`, about the other square. -/
def zeroLocusSubspaceHom (φ : E ⟶ B) (s : Fin k → B.presheaf.obj (op ⊤)) :
    E.zeroLocusSubspace (fun j ↦ φ.pullbackΓ (s j)) ⟶ B.zeroLocusSubspace s :=
  zeroLocusSubspaceLift (E.zeroLocusSubspaceι (fun j ↦ φ.pullbackΓ (s j)) ≫ φ) fun j ↦ by
    rw [Hom.pullbackΓ_comp]
    exact E.pullbackΓ_zeroLocusSubspaceι_eq_zero (fun j ↦ φ.pullbackΓ (s j)) j

/-- **The square commutes**: the comparison followed by the immersion of the zero locus of `s` is
the immersion of the zero locus of the pulled-back family followed by `φ`. This is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.zeroLocusSubspaceLift_comp` at the datum above, and it is the whole
of what the theorem below reads. -/

      E.zeroLocusSubspaceι (fun j ↦ φ.pullbackΓ (s j)) ≫ φ :=
  zeroLocusSubspaceLift_comp _ _

/-- **Finiteness is carried across a zero locus.** If `φ` is finite then so is the morphism it
induces between the zero locus of a pulled-back family and the zero locus of the family.

`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_of_isCutOutBy_of_comp_eq`
(`Oka/AnalyticSpace/Finite.lean`) at the square above and the two cut-out data
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCutOutBy_zeroLocusSubspaceι` supplies on each side. **Only the
`IsFinite` half is asked**: the base-change statements of
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/FiniteEtaleBaseChange.lean` are stated under `[IsFiniteEtale q]` — including
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isClosedMap_baseChangeSndBase` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.finite_fiber_baseChangeSndBase`, which spend only its `IsFinite`
field — and `Oka/AnalyticSpace/PullbackOpen.lean`'s
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isFinite_restrictHom` is along an open subspace, so neither reaches
a closed one.

**No limit is constructed and none is needed.** The statement is about the square, so it does not
wait on an identification of the source with a fibre product of `φ` and the immersion below it —
an identification no declaration of this repository states. -/

Two cancellations and then coordinates. `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_ofCutOut` cancels
the immersion of the base local model, leaving an equation of morphisms into `ℂ^p|U`;
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_restrict_complexAffineSpace` reduces that to the `p`
coordinate pullbacks; and each of those is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.pullbackΓ_eqCutFamily_fibreProdCutOutι`. **This is the step that
