# The binary product of two local models

`Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProductOpen.lean` makes `ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W` the binary product
of `ℂ^n|V` and `ℂ^m|W`. That is the *ambient* object of a product of two local models, and this
file cuts the product out inside it: if `X` is cut out in `ℂ^n|V` by `f₁, …, f_k` and `Y` is cut
out in `ℂ^m|W` by `g₁, …, g_l`, then **the zero locus, inside `ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W`, of
the `f j` pulled back along the first leg together with the `g j` pulled back along the second is
the binary product of `X` and `Y`.**

## The object costs no stalk-level work

`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.isCutOutBy_zeroLocusSubspaceι` in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalModel.lean` gives all four fields of `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy` — closed
embedding, image, surjectivity on stalks, kernel — for an arbitrary locally ringed space and an
arbitrary finite family of global sections, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` turns that datum into an analytic space carrying the
right `ℂ`-algebra structure. So the candidate product object is assembled and not constructed, and
nothing below computes a stalk. What has content is the universal property, and the universal
property is `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Factorisation.lean` used three
times: twice to build the projections and once to build the pair.

## The mapping property in the shape this file uses it

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift` and `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.existsUnique_liftHom` take a
morphism of *locally ringed spaces* into the ambient open subspace, together with a `ℂ`-linearity
hypothesis and the vanishing of the cutting sections. Everything this file pairs and cancels is a
morphism of *analytic spaces*, so that mapping property is repackaged at the analytic level
before the product is built: `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOutHom` is the closed immersion
as a morphism of analytic spaces, `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftHom` is the factorisation,
and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_ofCutOut` is uniqueness. **No transport is involved**:
the `ℂ`-algebra structure `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` installs is by definition the
ambient one pulled back along the immersion, so the `ℂ`-linearity of `ofCutOutHom` is `fun _ ↦ rfl`
and the one of `liftHom` is `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.isCLinearHom_lift` at the nose.

Those three are stated for an arbitrary closed immersion into an arbitrary `ℂ^n|V` and do not
mention the product. **Exactly one of those three has no earlier home, and it is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftHom`**: it is built from
`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift` and `ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.isCLinearHom_lift`, which arrive
in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Factorisation.lean`, and it lands in a
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict`, which arrives in
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean`. **Neither of those two files is in the other's import
closure**, so neither has both, and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftHom_comp` is forced with it.

**The section's other declarations are not forced, and their placement is a preference, which is
checkable and was checked rather than argued.** A file importing
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` and nothing else takes
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOutHom`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.toLRSHom_ofCutOutHom`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.pullbackΓ_ofCutOutHom_eq_zero`,
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_ofCutOutHom` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_ofCutOut`, bodies unchanged, with no output at all:
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` arrives in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalModel.lean`, which
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` imports, so that file has
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` and `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.restrict` alike, which
is all any of those names asks for. They are here so that the mapping property is stated in one
place, and because that file's subject is the open subspace where this is the mapping property of
a closed one. **That is a reason of taste and is given as one.**

**This paragraph read *"`Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` imports
`Oka/AnalyticSpace/LocalModel.lean`, so neither of those two files has both"* until 2026-09-07.**
That import is what gives `Oka/AnalyticSpace/OpenSubspace.lean` both, so the clause was false and
the import it cited was the reason it was false.

## The vanishing condition, which is the step this file was expected to fight

`ComplexAnalytic.IsCutOutBy.lift` asks that the morphism being factored kill the cutting sections
*as a map on global sections*, and what comes free from the zero-locus datum is the vanishing of
the *pulled-back* sections. Turning one into the other is contravariant functoriality of global
sections along a composite, which is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ_comp` in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/Basic.lean` — added there
by this branch, beside the `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ` it is about. With that
lemma each of the three vanishing obligations is two rewrites and a `map_zero`; without it the
`Γ.map` spelling puts the goal outside the `instances` transparency level and every later rewrite
is rejected, which is the seam
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.Hom.pullbackΓ`'s own docstring records.

## Main definitions

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOutHom`: the closed immersion of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` as a morphism of analytic spaces.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.liftHom`: the factorisation of a morphism of analytic spaces
  killing the cutting sections.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutFamily`: the `k + l` sections that cut the product out.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut`: the product object.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutι`: its closed immersion into
  `ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W`.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutFst` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutSnd`: the two projections.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutLift`: the pair.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutIsoProd`: the identification of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` with the categorical product `X ⨯ Y`.

## Main results

- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_ofCutOut`: **a morphism into
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` is determined by its composite with the immersion**,
  which is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.mono_of_isCutOutBy` in cancellation form.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isCutOutBy_prodCutFamily`: **the product object is cut out by
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutFamily`**, with no proof obligation of its own.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutLift_fst`,
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutLift_snd` and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_prodCutOut`: the two triangles and uniqueness.
- `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLimitBinaryFanProdCutOut`: **the zero locus of the appended
  family is the binary product of the two local models**, and
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasBinaryProduct_ofCutOut` is the instance.

## What is not here

* **`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasBinaryProducts ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace`.** What lands here is
  the product of two objects presented as `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.ofCutOut` — that is, of
  two *local models* — and nothing wider. A general analytic space is only locally a local model,
  and gluing the local products is a separate rung. At `8bfb421`, the commit this file first
  reached `master` in, `#synth CategoryTheory.Limits.HasBinaryProducts
  ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` fails — elaborated rather than grepped. **That clause named
  `bbbc91f` and called it this file's base until 2026-09-07.** `bbbc91f` is the base of
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProductOpen.lean`, where it is exact; this file imports that one and
  `bbbc91f` predates it, so this file cannot be put in that tree at all and the probe cannot be
  run there.
* **Anything over a base.** Both statements here are absolute products. The fibre product over a
  common base is an equaliser inside such a product; no construction below builds an equaliser or
  bears on `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullback`, and `#synth
  CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` fails at that same commit.

  **It is in `Oka/AnalyticSpace/CutOutFibreProduct.lean`**, which imports this file — one edge,
  measured — and which cuts the product below down by the `p` differences of the two composites to
  `ℂ^p`, giving `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullback` at a cospan of local models. **The bullet is
  unchanged by that and nothing here is retired**: *below* is this file, which still builds no
  equaliser, and `#synth CategoryTheory.Limits.HasPullbacks ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace` still
  fails at the commit that adds that file. This paragraph was added on 2026-09-07 by the push that
  added it.
* **Any description of the product on points.** The underlying set of
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` is the zero locus of the appended family, and no
  statement below identifies it with a set of pairs or computes the base map of either projection.
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.base_affineProdFst` and its companions in
  `Oka/AnalyticSpace/AffineProductOpen.lean` are what such a statement would run on.
* **Independence of the presentation.** `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOut` is indexed by
  the two cutting families and not by the two spaces, and two presentations of the same local
  model give two objects, canonically isomorphic through
  `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutIsoProd` at each and the universal property. Nothing
  below states that isomorphism.

reduces the goal to an equation of morphisms into `ℂ^(n+m)|affineProdOpens V W`, which
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_affineProdOpens` reduces to the two legs agreeing, and each
of those is the corresponding hypothesis pushed through
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutFst_fac`. -/

The lift is `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutLift` at the cone's two legs, the two
triangles are `ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutLift_fst` and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutLift_snd`, and uniqueness is
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hom_ext_prodCutOut`, which asks exactly what

/-- **The binary product of two local models exists**, so `X ⨯ Y` is usable notation at a pair of
them.

`CategoryTheory.Limits.HasBinaryProduct` is `Prop`-valued, so this instance loses the
identification of the product with the zero locus;
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.isLimitBinaryFanProdCutOut` is what keeps it, and
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.prodCutOutIsoProd` is that identification stated against the
notation. -/

/-- **The zero locus of the appended family is the categorical product**, as an isomorphism
against the `⨯` notation.

Two limits with the same diagram, so
`CategoryTheory.Limits.IsLimit.conePointUniqueUpToIso`. **The statement does not elaborate unless
`ComplexAnalytic.AnalyticSpace.hasBinaryProduct_ofCutOut` is found by instance search**, `⨯` being
notation for a `CategoryTheory.Limits.limit` that needs it; so this declaration, and the guard on
it, test that the instance is found and not merely that it exists. -/
