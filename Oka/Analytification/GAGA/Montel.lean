# Montel's theorem in several variables

Let `E` be a finite-dimensional complex normed space and `U ⊆ E` open. A family of holomorphic
functions on `U` which is uniformly bounded on every compact subset of `U` is relatively compact
for the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of `U`.

The proof is the classical one: a bound `M` on a ball `B(z, R)` gives, by the Schwarz lemma
applied on the complex line through `z` and `y`, the Lipschitz estimate
`‖f y - f z‖ ≤ 2M/R ‖y - z‖`, so the family is equicontinuous, and the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem
applies. Limits are holomorphic by Weierstrass' theorem
(`differentiableOn_of_tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn`).

## Main results

- `norm_sub_le_of_differentiableOn_ball`: the Cauchy-type estimate above.
- `equicontinuous_restrict_of_differentiableOn`: a locally uniformly bounded family of
  holomorphic functions on `U` is equicontinuous on `U`.
- `isCompact_closure_of_differentiableOn`: **Montel's theorem**, compactness form: such a family
  has compact closure in `C(U, ℂ)` (compact-open topology).
- `exists_subseq_tendstoLocallyUniformlyOn`: **Montel's theorem**, sequential form: a locally
  uniformly bounded sequence of holomorphic functions on `U` has a subsequence converging locally
  uniformly on `U` to a holomorphic function.
