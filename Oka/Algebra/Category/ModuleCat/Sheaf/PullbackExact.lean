# Pullback of sheaves of modules along a stalkwise flat morphism is left exact

Material for `Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/PullbackContinuous.lean`; see `README.md`
on the mirror tree. It is the other half of
`Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/PullbackStalk.lean`:

```
SheafOfModules.preservesFiniteLimits_pullback
    (hflat : ∀ x, (PresheafOfModules.ringStalkMap f φ x).hom.Flat) :
  PreservesFiniteLimits (pullback (sheafRingHom φ))
```

Right exactness of `SheafOfModules.pullback` is free — it is a left adjoint — so this is the
whole of its exactness, and **it is where flatness is consumed**. The base-change formula of
`Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/PullbackStalk.lean` uses none — and the path is written out
because `Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Presheaf/PullbackStalk.lean` states the same result one
level down, so the file name alone names two files.

## The route, and it is monomorphisms rather than short complexes

A right-exact additive functor between abelian categories is exact as soon as it preserves
monomorphisms (`CategoryTheory.Functor.preservesHomology_of_preservesMonos_and_cokernels`, then
`CategoryTheory.Functor.preservesFiniteLimits_of_preservesHomology`). So the only thing to prove
is `PreservesMonomorphisms`, and monomorphisms of sheaves of modules are detected on stalks:

* `SheafOfModules.preservesMonomorphisms_stalkFunctor` — the module-valued stalk functor
  preserves monomorphisms, because the `AddCommGrpCat`-valued one does
  (`Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Stalk.lean`) and `forget₂` reflects them. **The two
  stalk functors agree by `rfl`**, which is what makes this one line rather than a transport;
* `SheafOfModules.mono_of_forall_mono_stalkFunctor_map` — the converse, from
  `SheafOfModules.exact_of_stalk_exact` applied to `0 ⟶ M ⟶ N` together with
  `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.exact_iff_mono`.

Given those, the proof is: transport along `SheafOfModules.pullbackStalkIso`, and observe that
`ModuleCat.extendScalars` along a flat ring map preserves monomorphisms because it preserves
finite limits (`ModuleCat.preservesFiniteLimits_extendScalars_of_flat`,
`Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Descent.lean`).

**The short-complex route is available and is longer.** Concluding from `S.Exact` that the stalks
are exact needs `SheafOfModules.toSheaf` to be *right* exact as well, which at `v4.32.0` — the
revision `lakefile.toml` pins, resolved by `lake-manifest.json` to
`81a5d257c8e410db227a6665ed08f64fea08e997` — Mathlib does not have; going through monomorphisms
needs only the direction that is there.

**That absence is measured in this repository already, and this sentence points at the run rather
than repeating the claim.** `Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Stalk.lean`'s passage on the
converse of `SheafOfModules.exact_of_stalk_exact` carries the instrument, the verdict and a
positive control: Mathlib has `CategoryTheory.Limits.PreservesFiniteLimits` for that functor
(`Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Limits.lean`) and `inferInstance` fails on both
`CategoryTheory.Limits.PreservesFiniteColimits` and `CategoryTheory.Functor.PreservesHomology`.
**That passage is named here by what it is about and not by where it sits**, because a pointer
into another file's structure is falsified by any rearrangement of that file; at `6a792ba` it is
the first bullet of that file's `## What is not here`.
**That passage carried no version when this sentence was written, on 2026-09-21**, which the rule
in `OkaTest/Axioms.lean` asks of the sentence that measures as much as of the sentence that
points; repairing it is a change to a file this push only reads, and is filed as taxis #2152.

**The absence is Mathlib's and not this repository's, and when this sentence was written, on
2026-09-21, that passage did not say so.**
`Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Colimits.lean` declares
`SheafOfModules.preservesFiniteColimits_toSheaf`, so `inferInstance` for
`CategoryTheory.Limits.PreservesFiniteColimits (SheafOfModules.toSheaf R)` **succeeds** under
`import Oka` and **fails** under `import Mathlib` alone at the revision above; both were run.
So what makes the short-complex route longer *here* is not that nobody has proved right
exactness — it is that **this file does not import that module**, while the monomorphism route
needs no import this file does not already have. **That passage then said *So the converse is a
theorem someone has to prove and not a transfer*, which a module of this repository two days
older than the file it sits in refutes**; repairing it is filed as taxis #2152, and that module
is out of scope here as well. At `6a792ba` that is the fourth of its five sentences and not its
last, and `git show 6a792ba:Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/Stalk.lean` carries it at
`:84–85`, wrapped after *has to*.

**That clause read *which Mathlib does not have (recorded in `Sheaf/Stalk.lean`)* until
2026-09-22**, with no version and with a pointer naming a file rather than the passage in it;
`git show c6bfc1f:Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/PullbackExact.lean` carries the retired
wording at `:52–53`, wrapped after *does not have*. **The claim is unchanged and only its warrant
is.**

## The check this file is built to pass

*A proof of left exactness that consumes no flatness is proving something false*: pullback along
an arbitrary morphism of ringed spaces is not left exact. **Measured**: deleting
`ModuleCat.preservesFiniteLimits_extendScalars_of_flat (hflat x)` from
`preservesMonomorphisms_pullback` makes that proof, and nothing else in this file, fail with
`failed to synthesize (ModuleCat.extendScalars _).PreservesMonomorphisms`. So flatness enters at
exactly one place and it is the expected one.

## Main results

- `SheafOfModules.preservesMonomorphisms_stalkFunctor`,
  `SheafOfModules.mono_of_forall_mono_stalkFunctor_map`: monomorphisms of sheaves of modules on a
  space are exactly those that are monomorphisms on every stalk.
- `SheafOfModules.preservesMonomorphisms_pullback`.
- `SheafOfModules.preservesFiniteLimits_pullback`: **the theorem.**

## What is not here

* **Faithful flatness.** Only flatness is used. What faithful flatness would additionally give —
  that the pullback reflects isomorphisms — is
  `ModuleCat.reflectsIsomorphisms_extendScalars_of_faithfullyFlat` stalkwise, and nothing here
  needs it.
* **Coherence.** No finiteness hypothesis on the sheaves appears anywhere; the statement is for
  all sheaves of modules.
