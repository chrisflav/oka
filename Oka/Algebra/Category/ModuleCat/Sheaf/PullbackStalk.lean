# The stalk of a pullback of sheaves of modules is the base change of the stalk

Material for `Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/PullbackContinuous.lean`; see `README.md`
on the mirror tree. This is the sheaf-level form of
`Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Presheaf/PullbackStalk.lean`:

```
SheafOfModules.pullbackStalkIso :
  pullback φ ⋙ stalkFunctor x ≅ stalkFunctor (f x) ⋙ ModuleCat.extendScalars (ringStalkMap f φ x)
```

— **`(f^* M)_x ≅ 𝒪_{X,x} ⊗_{𝒪_{Y,f x}} M_{f x}`, naturally in `M`.**

## What the sheaf level costs over the presheaf level

Exactly one thing: `PresheafOfModules.skyscraper_isSheaf`. Everything else transfers across
`SheafOfModules.forget`, which is fully faithful and which `SheafOfModules.pushforward` commutes
with **definitionally** — `((pushforward φ).obj M).val` is
`(PresheafOfModules.pushforward φ.hom).obj M.val` by `rfl`. So the natural isomorphism of right
adjoints is the presheaf one wrapped in `⟨·⟩`, and
the two triangle identities are `SheafOfModules.hom_ext` applied to the presheaf ones.

**Nothing here unfolds `SheafOfModules.pullback`**, which is just as well: it is defined as
`(pushforward φ).leftAdjoint`, and the one description of it that decomposes the functor,
`SheafOfModules.pullbackIso`, writes it as a presheaf pullback followed by sheafification and so
would drag in "sheafification does not change stalks", which at `v4.32.0` — the revision
`lakefile.toml` pins, resolved by `lake-manifest.json` to
`81a5d257c8e410db227a6665ed08f64fea08e997` — Mathlib does not have in this generality. The
adjoint-uniqueness proof needs neither.

**That is two claims and they take two instruments**, and both are scans of *types* over the
environment of `import Mathlib` at that rev rather than greps over its source. The reason is
worth one clause, because it is a trap this neighbourhood sets: the namespace is open throughout
`Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/`, so the functor is written `pullback` there and
`grep -rn "SheafOfModules.pullback" Mathlib/` returns **7** occurrences in **1** file where the
environment has **22** declarations whose type mentions it. The two figures are not a ratio:
occurrences in source against declarations in an environment, several of the 22 being generated
lemmas no source line writes. That is the point — the qualified grep is not a short count of the
population these claims are about, it is a count of a different population.

**Decomposes the functor.** Of those **22**, `SheafOfModules.pullbackIso` is the only one that
writes the functor as a composite. The near misses are named here rather than left for a reader
to rediscover, and each of them is a description that does not unfold it:
`SheafOfModules.sheafificationCompPullback` commutes it past sheafification,
`SheafOfModules.pullbackObjFreeIso` and `SheafOfModules.freeFunctorCompPullbackIso` give its
value on free sheaves, and `SheafOfModules.pullbackId` and `SheafOfModules.pullbackComp` are the
functoriality isomorphisms.

**Does not have it in this generality.** The sheafification `SheafOfModules.pullbackIso` goes
through is `PresheafOfModules.sheafification`, and of the **21** declarations whose type mentions
that functor, **none** mentions `TopCat.Presheaf.stalk`, `TopCat.Presheaf.stalkFunctor` or
`TopCat.Presheaf.germ` — against **544** in that environment whose type mentions one of the
three, which is the positive control that says the scan is pointed at something Mathlib has in
quantity. **What Mathlib does have is what makes *in this generality* the load-bearing clause
rather than hedging**: `TopCat.Presheaf.sheafifyStalkIso`
(`Mathlib/Topology/Sheaves/Sheafify.lean:124`) for `Type`-valued presheaves, and
`TopCat.Presheaf.stalkFunctor_map_unit_toSheafify_isIso` (`:137`) for presheaves valued in any
category with `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasColimits`, `CategoryTheory.Limits.HasTerminal` and
`CategoryTheory.HasWeakSheafify`. Both are about an `X.Presheaf C` for one fixed `C`, and a
presheaf of modules is not of that form; Mathlib's stalk API for one,
`Mathlib/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Stalk.lean`, stops at the module structure on
`TopCat.Presheaf.stalk` and relates it to no sheafification.

**That clause read *Mathlib's only structural description of it, `SheafOfModules.pullbackIso`,
decomposes it as a presheaf pullback followed by sheafification and so would drag in
"sheafification does not change stalks", which Mathlib does not have in this generality* until
2026-09-22**, with no version and no run behind either half;
`git show c6bfc1f:Oka/Algebra/Category/ModuleCat/Sheaf/PullbackStalk.lean` carries the retired
wording at `:33–36`, wrapped after *in this*. **Both claims are unchanged in substance and only
their warrant is**, save that *only structural description* is now *the one description that
decomposes the functor*, because five of the others describe it too, which is
the count *Decomposes the functor* above names and glosses one by one.

## Sheaves of *commutative* rings

`SheafOfModules R` wants `R : Sheaf J RingCat`, and the stalk of a `RingCat`-valued presheaf is a
`RingCat`. `ModuleCat.extendScalars` is available only between **commutative** rings, so the
statement has to know that the stalks are commutative. `SheafOfModules.ofCommRingCat` is the
wrapper that says so: it takes a `CommRingCat`-valued presheaf together with a proof that its
composite with `forget₂` is a sheaf, which is exactly the data
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.ringSheaf` is built from — and `ringSheaf` is
*definitionally* of this form, recorded as
`AlgebraicGeometry.LocallyRingedSpace.ringSheaf_eq_ofCommRingCat`.

## Main definitions

- `SheafOfModules.ofCommRingCat`, `SheafOfModules.stalkFunctor`,
  `SheafOfModules.skyscraper`, `SheafOfModules.skyscraperFunctor`.
- `SheafOfModules.sheafRingHom`: the morphism of sheaves of rings attached to a morphism of
  presheaves of commutative rings over a continuous map.

## Main results

- `SheafOfModules.stalkSkyscraperAdj`: `stalkFunctor x ⊣ skyscraperFunctor x`.
- `SheafOfModules.skyscraperFunctorPushforwardIso`: the pushforward of a skyscraper sheaf is a
  skyscraper sheaf.
- `SheafOfModules.pullbackStalkIso`: **the stalk of a pullback is the base change of the stalk.**

## What is not here

* **Exactness.** No flatness is used and none is needed; the base-change formula holds for an
  arbitrary morphism of ringed spaces. Turning it into exactness of the pullback is where
  flatness enters, and that is a separate theorem.
